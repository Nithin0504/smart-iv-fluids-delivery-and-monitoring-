# Smart-iv-fluids-delivery-and-monitoring

Project Description :

Lack of patient care in the healthcare sector has led to many hazardous complications in the patients.One such field is iv fluid delivery. Wrong delivery of iv fluids or inconvinience in  monitoring it's timely delivery can be solved with the smart iv fluid delivery system.

This project consists 4 components: Webpage / Mobile app, Smart band , Flow Rate Monitor, Pressure Control Clamp

1) Webpage/mobile app: The webpage contains patient's details such as name , blood group , etc . The Doctor reviews patient data and inputs necessary parameters such as flow rate of the iv fluid , type of the iv fluid etc. via the webpage/ mobile app. The data collected from the smart band is also visible on the webpage/mobile app.
2) Smart Band: It monitors heart rate , Blood pressure and temperature of the patient and sends this data to the Webpage.
3) Flow rate monitor: This device is attached to the drip chamber of the iv fluid setup. It is used to calculate the flow rate of the liquid, and the pressure clamp is adjusted accordingly.
4) Pressure control clamp: The pipe is fed into this clamp and the clamp applies pressure onto the pipe as required so that the flowrate matches with the doctor's inputs.

Whenever the patient's vitals are abnormal , the fluid delivery is stopped and alerts are sent to the webpage/mobile app.
